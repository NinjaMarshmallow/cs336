Lab 6

	Exercise 1. 

		a) Chrome, Firefox, and other web browsers can only use GET requests and occasionally POST requests for submitting form data because they are built for web browsing for web editing. 

		Curl can send GET, HEAD, PUT, POST, and DELETE requests because Curl is built to be a comprehensive HTTP tool.

		Curl Commands Used:

			curl localhost:3000/request
			curl --head localhost:3000/request
			curl -X PUT -d '{"value":"bob"}' localhost:3000/request
			curl -X POST -d '{"value":"gerald"}' localhost:3000/request
			curl -X DELETE -d '{"value":"bob"}' localhost:3000/request

		b) The most appropriate HTTP code for undefined routes is the 404 not found error.

	Excercise 2.

		a) Forms usually uses GET to show to the user and POST to send to the webserver, but PUT and DELETE are also supported

		b) The Form data is passed back to the server using the HTTP request method POST. The different fields are combined into a JSON object and sent inside the POST request. The server then unpacks the JSON object into the seperate fields.
