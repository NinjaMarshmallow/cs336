	a. The React Router allows for the appearance of different pages with different URLs without having seperate static html files. This makes it look more like a proper application instead of a web page
	
	b. Browser History seems to be the better option because it looks cleaner. The hash history makes a hash code suffix appear on the end of the URL whereas the Browser History allows you to create customized URLs that correspond with different React Routes
	
	c. The server must be modified to accomodate Browser History because it essentially repurposes the address bar from routing between different static files to routing between different virtual pages called Routes.

	a. The CommentEdit component contains state information of "author" and "text", the essential features of a comment whereas the CommentBox contains state of "data" which is a list of comments. The CommentEdit component mutates the state it has, but the CommentBox just passes it along to the CommentList component.

	b. Once the database request PUT or DELETE returns successful, the CommentEdit component navigates to the main page to show the change. The cancel button is simply just a label with a click listener which navigates the the main page without modifying the database.

	c. The Link tag is a React Class, which instead of being a normal HTML hyperlink it translates the address its given to the React Route associated with the address.
